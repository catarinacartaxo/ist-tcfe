In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing a complex electric circuit using different circuit analysis methods mesh method and node voltage method has been achieved. The circuit was theoretically analysed combining each of the circuit analysis methods and the Octave maths tool and by running a circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool. The simulation results matched the results obtained with the Node Voltage Method precisely, but were not totally satisfactory regarding the Mesh Method. The reason for this mismatch using the Mesh Method were the equations used to solve the problem. When dealing with circuits with so many components it gets difficult to evaluate each of the components' signs, which way the current is flowing, etc, and a mixed sign can greatly affect the outcome. Opposed to this, the reason for the perfect match obtained using the Mesh Method is the fact that this is a straightforward circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical and simulation models cannot
