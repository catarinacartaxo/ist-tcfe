\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing a complex electric
circuit using different circuit analysis methods mesh method and node voltage
method has been achieved. The circuit was theoretically analysed combining
each of the circuit analysis methods and the Octave maths tool and by running
a circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool. The simulation results matched
the theoretical results precisely. The reason for the
perfect match is the fact that this is a
straightforward circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical
and simulation models cannot differ.
