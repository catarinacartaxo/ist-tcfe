\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\paragraph{} In this laboratory assignment the objective of built and analyse a circuit capable of
converting a AC voltage to a DC has not been quiet
achieved. The time analyses has been performed both
theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the
Ngspice tool. The simulation results not always matched with the theoretical results perfectly.
However, the final results of the output voltage was very similar between the two analyses.
