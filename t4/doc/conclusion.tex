\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\paragraph{} In this laboratory assignment the objective of develop a audio amplifier circuit has been
achieved. The simulation results have matched with the theoretical results almost perfectly, means that the gain,
the input and output impedances and Vo(f)/Vi(f) are similar in the two parts of this work.
