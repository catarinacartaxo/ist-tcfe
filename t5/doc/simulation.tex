\section{Simulation Analysis}
\label{sec:simulation}


\paragraph{} Using ngspice we are able to produce this graphs and obtain the values of the gain, central
frequency and input and output impedances. This results will be showed later on. We were also able to optain
the value of merith which is showed in the table below.
